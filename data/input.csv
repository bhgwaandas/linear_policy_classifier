"INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN MediaNews does not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity. We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any web site and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information. MediaNews limits its collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. first name, screen names, age, gender, city, state, zip code and country of residence). This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. completing polls or online surveys, posting jokes, book reviews, movie reviews, toy reviews, video reviews, concert reviews, game reviews, artwork or questions/comments online, or playing online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or parent's or guardian's email address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes, email newsletters and offers, provide subscriptions, participate in chat rooms and message boards, or offer other online activities. MediaNews does not and cannot condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Information is collected actively, such as through registration forms, and passively, such as through cookies."

"USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN MediaNews occasionally offers contest and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. When a child under thirteen 13 enters a contest or sweepstakes, or participates in another activity that requires the use of personal information, we will ask for a parent's email address so that we can notify the parent of the child's participation, obtain the parent's consent and give the parent the option to have the child's information deleted. All of the child's personal information collected by MediaNews is securely maintained and used only for the specified purpose such as conducting the contest or sweepstakes and awarding prizes. MediaNews does not keep any of the child's personal information after the particular event is completed. Sometimes, MediaNews uses agents or contractors to provide services that support the internal operations of the site, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes or sending prizes to winners. In these cases, MediaNews requires the agent or contractor to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information and limit use to the specific services they are performing on our behalf."

"Protecting Personal and Protected Health Information The security of our sites and services and the information they store, process and transmit is a top priority. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the information we collect, we deploy a wide range of technical, physical and administrative safeguards,"
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
; housing health data in secure facilities that restrict physical and network access;
"regular evaluation and enhancement of our information technology systems, facilities, and information collection, storage and processing practices."
When you enter payment information we encrypt the transmission of that information using SSL technology and do not store it on our systems.
"It is important to remember, however, that no system can guarantee 100 security at all times. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of information stored on or transmitted to or from our services. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers and systems. When disclosing any personal or protected health information, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to the public and,consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. Accordingly, you should consider carefully if you want to submit sensitive information that you would not want disclosed to the public and should recognize that your use of the Internet and our sites and services is solely at your risk. You are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy for all your personal information, including your protected health information. Except as provided in aBusiness Associate Agreement between us and a healthcare provider, we have no responsibility or liability to anyone for the security of your personal or protected health information transmitted via the Internet."
"Steps You Can Take Install malware detection programs that regularly scan your system and incoming traffic for malicious code such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan Horses and spyware. Because viruses and malware are continuously created and modified, regular malware protection software typically requires frequent updates."
Use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to your device.
"Because malware often targets vulnerabilities in existing operating systems, browsers, plug-ins and other programs, software vendors frequently update their products with security patches to guard against known or commonly exploited vulnerabilities. Vendors often try to alert their users and recommend immediate installation of these security patches."
Use a strong password using a combination of letters and numbers that are not easily guessed. Do not share your password with others.
"If you use a shared device, always close all active programs and log out before leaving it unattended."
"Avoid using a public wireless network, if possible. If you do use a public network, use the most restrictive wireless network settings on your device."
"If you use file-sharing programs, be sure to restrict all other folders or directories to ""no share""."
"Be very cautious with any email requesting you to share personal information. On websites, look for the lock symbol on or near your browser's address bar which signifies a secure website before supplying personal information."
"When participating in one of our communities, blogs, forums, surveys or other open communication platforms, exercise care in selecting what information you share, particularly personal or health information."
"Depending on the features, your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing"
"HIPAA Our sites and services may include collection, transmission and storage of protected health information you submit for healthcare providers or that healthcare providers submit to us and is subject to special rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or ""HIPAA"".

"For example, when the e-mail address 'U13user@dictionary.com' is hashed, the result or ""hash value"" might be 'a8der13ap69'.
