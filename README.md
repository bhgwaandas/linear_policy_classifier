# linear_policy_classifier

We have created a text classifier which uses relevant labels set up by us to classify texts from a policy using TF-IDF, and use conditional args to provide a rating to said policy.

We have divided problem into two categories: 
1. What consumer face
2. What business face 
For consumers, we will help them to know what they are signing up for and for businesses we will help them to review their policy and grade them.
